# Let YOU Cook  

## Inspiration  
The inspiration behind **Let YOU Cook** came from a mix of real-world problems and personal experiences. The obesity crisis, the need for better nutrition, and the struggle of college students relying on instant noodles were key motivators. We wanted to create a tool that makes healthy eating easier, more accessible, and sustainable—without requiring expert cooking skills or extensive meal planning time.

## What it does  
**Let YOU Cook** is an AI-powered web app that customizes recipes based on your dietary needs, allergies, food preferences, and even sustainability goals. Let YOU Cook is an AI-powered web app that generates personalized recipes based on your:
- Dietary preferences (vegan, keto, halal, kosher, etc.)
- Allergies and intolerances
- Nutritional deficiencies
- Likes and dislikes
- Available ingredients
- Carbon footprint of ingredients
- Religious or ethical food restrictions
- Grocery budget (future feature)
It doesn’t just use what’s in your fridge—it can also suggest grocery lists to optimize meal planning for the week, ensuring zero food waste.

## How we built it  
We used:  
- **Lovable AI** to help develop the AI-powered recipe generator  
- **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface  
- **MongoDB** for storing user preferences and meal plans  
- **Python** as the backbone of the app  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration  
- **ChatGPT** for recipe recommendations and enhancements  

## Challenges we ran into  
One of the biggest challenges was learning and integrating new technologies like **Lovable AI** and **Streamlit**, while also mastering established tools like **MongoDB**.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
We’re proud that we built something functional and useful by the end of the project! Seeing the app generate personalized meal plans successfully was a big win.  

## What we learned  
- How to integrate AI into recipe generation  
- The power of **Streamlit** for rapid web app development  
- Database management with **MongoDB**  
- The importance of efficient grocery planning in reducing food waste  

## What's next for Let YOU Cook  
- Incorporating **cheapest grocery prices near you** for budget-friendly meal planning  
- Adapting recipes based on **sleep cycle** (e.g., simpler breakfasts if you sleep late)  
- Creating **leftover recipes** to further reduce food waste
